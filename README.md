# City-Explorer-API

**Author**: Kao Saelor

**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This application is a web-based tool that provides weather forecasts and location-based data for cities around the world. It consists of a custom API server built using Node.js, npm, and Express.js, and a front-end application built using React.js and Axios. The goal is to provide users with a reliable and user-friendly tool for accessing weather and location-based data.

## Getting Started
To hook up a front-end React application with a back-end server, you can create an Express server from scratch. Here are the steps:

- Install Node.js
- Create a new project directory
- Initialize a new Node.js project
- Install Express
- Create an index.js file to serve as the entry point for your Express server
- Define routes to handle incoming requests
- Start the server

Once the server is up and running, make HTTP requests to it from your React components using libraries like axios or fetch

## Architecture
The application is designed with Node.js, npm, Express.js, and dotenv for the back-end, and React.js and Axios for the front-end. Node.js runs the server-side, npm manages dependencies, Express.js builds the API, and dotenv handles sensitive information. React.js creates reusable UI components and manages application state, while Axios makes HTTP requests.
